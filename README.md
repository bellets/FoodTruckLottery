# FoodTruckLottery
The Food Truck Lottery is a command-line application that allows users to filter food trucks based on certain criteria and randomly selects a food truck from the filtered list. Additionally, the system can return a list of 10 food trucks for a particular cuisine and provide more intuitive location information using the Google Maps API.
